# FireFoundry SDK Core Concepts

*Generated by Claude*

This directory contains comprehensive guides to the three foundational concepts of the FireFoundry Agent Bundle SDK:

- **Entities** - The structure and state management system
- **Bots** - AI-powered behaviors using LLMs  
- **Prompts** - Structured templates for LLM interactions

Together, these components form the Entity-Bot-Prompt architecture that separates structure from behavior, enabling sophisticated AI workflows while maintaining clear organization and extensibility.

## Core Architecture Overview

The FireFoundry SDK follows a unique pattern where:
1. **Entities** represent business objects and their relationships in a persistent graph
2. **Bots** implement AI-powered behaviors through structured LLM interactions  
3. **Prompts** define the structure and content of LLM requests
4. **Runnable Entities** connect entities and bots, providing context from the entity graph to the bot

This separation allows for clear division of responsibilities, independent development, and flexible composition of complex AI capabilities.

### Essential Guides

- **[Entity Modeling and Development](entities.md)** - Complete guide to the entity framework including graph-based relationships, runnable entities, job scheduling, and advanced patterns like waitable entities and work queues.

- **[Writing Bots](bots.md)** - Comprehensive bot development guide covering architecture, request-response flow, tool calls, error handling, progress tracking, and real-world implementation examples.

- **[Prompting Framework](prompting.md)** - Deep dive into the structured prompting system including template nodes, programmatic control flow, working memory integration, schema definitions, and best practices.

### Getting Started Recommendation

For newcomers to the FireFoundry SDK, we recommend this learning path:

1. Start with the [Getting Started Guide](../agent_sdk_getting_started.md) for hands-on experience
2. Read [Entity Modeling](entities.md) to understand the foundational architecture  
3. Study [Writing Bots](bots.md) to learn AI-powered behavior implementation
4. Explore [Prompting Framework](prompting.md) to master LLM interactions
5. Try the [Feature Guides](../feature_guides/) for specific advanced patterns

Each guide includes working code examples, best practices, and real-world implementation patterns from production FireFoundry applications.

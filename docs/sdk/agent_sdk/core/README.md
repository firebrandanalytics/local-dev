# FireFoundry SDK Core Concepts

*Generated by Claude*

This directory contains comprehensive guides to the three foundational concepts of the FireFoundry Agent Bundle SDK:

- **Entities** - The structure and state management system
- **Bots** - AI-powered behaviors using LLMs  
- **Prompts** - Structured templates for LLM interactions

Together, these components form the Entity-Bot-Prompt architecture that separates structure from behavior, enabling sophisticated AI workflows while maintaining clear organization and extensibility.

## Core Architecture Overview

The FireFoundry SDK follows a unique pattern where:
1. **Entities** represent business objects and their relationships in a persistent graph
2. **Bots** implement AI-powered behaviors through structured LLM interactions  
3. **Prompts** define the structure and content of LLM requests
4. **Runnable Entities** connect entities and bots, providing context from the entity graph to the bot

This separation allows for clear division of responsibilities, independent development, and flexible composition of complex AI capabilities.

### Tutorials

For a hands-on, step-by-step introduction to the core components, start with these tutorials. They build on each other to teach the fundamentals of creating AI behaviors in isolation.

- **[Building Your First Prompt](prompting_tutorial.md)** - A guided walkthrough of the Prompting Framework. Learn to create a dynamic, structured prompt from scratch.
- **[Building Your First Bot](bot_tutorial.md)** - Learn how to bring a prompt to life by wrapping it in a Bot that can handle validation, use tools, and recover from errors.

### Essential Guides

These are comprehensive reference guides that cover the architecture and advanced features of each core component in detail.

- **[Entity Modeling and Development](entities.md)** - Complete guide to the entity framework including graph-based relationships, runnable entities, job scheduling, and advanced patterns like waitable entities and work queues.

- **[Writing Bots](bots.md)** - Comprehensive bot development guide covering architecture, request-response flow, tool calls, error handling, progress tracking, and real-world implementation examples.

- **[Prompting Framework](prompting.md)** - Deep dive into the structured prompting system including template nodes, programmatic control flow, working memory integration, schema definitions, and best practices.

### Getting Started Recommendation

For newcomers to the FireFoundry SDK, we recommend this learning path:

1.  Start with the [Getting Started Guide](../agent_sdk_getting_started.md) for a complete, high-level tour of building an application with the Entity-Bot-Prompt pattern.
2.  Work through the **[Tutorials](#tutorials)** above to get a focused, hands-on understanding of creating prompts and bots.
3.  Dive into the **[Essential Guides](#essential-guides)** for a deep, architectural understanding of Entities, Bots, and Prompts.
4.  Explore the [Feature Guides](../feature_guides/) for specific advanced patterns and capabilities.

Each guide includes working code examples, best practices, and real-world implementation patterns from production FireFoundry applications.

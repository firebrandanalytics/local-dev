# FireFoundry SDK Feature Guides

*Generated by Claude*

This directory contains focused guides for specific FireFoundry SDK features and advanced implementation patterns. Each guide provides practical, working examples that you can adapt to your own applications.

## What Are Feature Guides?

Feature guides are targeted tutorials that demonstrate how to implement specific capabilities within the FireFoundry Agent Bundle SDK. Unlike the comprehensive core concept guides, these focus on practical "how-to" scenarios with complete code examples and real-world patterns.

Each guide assumes familiarity with the basic Entity-Bot-Prompt architecture covered in the [Core Concepts](../core/) documentation.

## Links and Further Reading

### Integration and External Systems

- **[Tool Calls](ad_hoc_tool_calls.md)** - Add external function calling capabilities to your bots for data lookup, calculations, and API integrations. Learn to create dispatch tables and enable LLMs to invoke external services.

- **[File Upload Patterns](file-upload-patterns.md)** - Comprehensive developer guide for implementing binary file upload, storage, and retrieval using the Context Service Client and Agent Bundle SDK with proper architectural separation.

- **[Working with Files](uploading_files_example.md)** - Practical tutorial showing how to upload binary files to Working Memory using the Context Service Client and process them within runnable entities.

### Entity Graph Patterns

- **[Graph Traversal](graph_traversal.md)** - Navigate entity relationships and connections through typed edges to build complex queries, find related entities, and implement graph-based workflows.

### Advanced Capabilities

- **[Vector Similarity](vector-similarity-quickstart.md)** - Add semantic search capabilities to your entities with pre-computed embeddings, similarity matching, and the new gRPC broker integration for embedding generation.

- **[Waitable Entities](waitable_guide.md)** - Build human-in-the-loop workflows that can pause execution indefinitely, wait for external input, and resume processing with received data through REST APIs or promise-based messaging.

## Implementation Patterns

These guides demonstrate several key architectural patterns:

- **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between file handling, business logic, and AI processing
- **External System Integration** - Proper use of Context Service Client vs Agent Bundle SDK
- **Graph-Based Modeling** - Representing complex business domains as connected entities
- **Human-in-the-Loop** - Building interactive workflows that incorporate human decision-making
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Starting simple and adding advanced capabilities incrementally

## Prerequisites

Most feature guides assume you have:
- Completed the [Getting Started Guide](../agent_sdk_getting_started.md)
- Basic understanding of [Entity Modeling](../core/entities.md) and [Bot Development](../core/bots.md)
- A working FireFoundry development environment

Specific technical prerequisites are listed at the beginning of each guide.

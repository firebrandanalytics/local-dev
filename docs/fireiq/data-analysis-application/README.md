# FireIQ Data Analysis Application

The FireIQ Data Analysis Application helps you prepare datasets for use in the chat application by leveraging AI to build data dictionaries, ontologies, and tool configurations.

## Overview

This application assists with:
- **Data Ingestion**: Import and process new datasets
- **Data Cleansing**: Identify and resolve data quality issues
- **Data Analysis**: Understand dataset structure and content
- **Preparation**: Generate the artifacts needed for chat agent bundles

## Purpose

The data analysis application bridges the gap between raw data and conversational access. It helps you:

1. Analyze new datasets to understand their structure
2. Build comprehensive data dictionaries
3. Define ontologies that capture business concepts
4. Configure tool calls for data access patterns
5. Generate configuration for customized chat agent bundles

## Workflow

1. Ingest a new dataset
2. Run AI-assisted analysis and cleansing
3. Review and refine data dictionaries
4. Define ontologies and relationships
5. Configure available operations
6. Export configuration for agent bundle creation
